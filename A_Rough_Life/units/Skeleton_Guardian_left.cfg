    description= _ "Normally, warriors that have been slain in battle and brought back by dark magics are nearly mindless and unwavering in their purpose, fearing neither pain nor death. Every now and then, however, something goes amiss in the process, and the resulting skeleton retains some of its former awareness, yet hampered by the horrifying experience of dying vividly etched in its mind."
