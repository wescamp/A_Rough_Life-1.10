There were humans, no doubt tricked unawares like himself, but also several other races: sturdy little dwarves, pointy-eared elves, even merfolk that Jacques only ever saw in his dreams."

But not on that day, and not in the following weeks that he spent being seasick and homesick as the ship cut through the waves on its journey, day in and day out. Every now and then, a few of the captives would be taken away, and occasionally others would join the unfortunate crowd."

        [part]
            story= _ "Finally, his turn came. Weakened from the long journey, he was taken ashore in a wondrous land, which to eyes unaccustomed to light seemed full of glistening golden sparkle. Jacques felt his spirits lifting as soon as he stepped on hard soil, but they sank again when, a few hours of tedious marching later, he and a few of his newfound friends were led into a cave and left open air behind them once more."

        [part]
            story= _ "Once underground, they walked on for what seemed like an eternity. Jacques started thinking that he would never see the light of day again. Still, a wondrous sight opened up to the captives as they were finally pushed into what seemed like a grand chamber."
