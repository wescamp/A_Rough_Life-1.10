            story= _ "Jacques spent the rest of the night in thought, trying to decide how to go about destroying the mountain stronghold and restoring the river to the valley. In the morning, he decided he could wait no longer. One more day and the brutes left on the mountain would become restless with their delegation not returning, and the element of surprise would be lost."

        [part]
            story= _ "Jacques decided to assemble a group of his seasoned warriors to help him on this last mission. He was glad to see some of his old friends still around him, and was grateful for their assistance even as he dreaded that something might happen to them."

        [part]
            story= _ "The only one that he desperately wanted to leave behind was Kyoko. He had no idea what waited for them on top of the mountain, and he wished to protect her. Kyoko, however, would have none of it. She refused to play the stereotype of a woman left behind while her man goes on to fight, and challenged to fight anyone that would deem fit to try and stop her from going."

        [part]
            story= _ "Thus it was that the group set out for the mountains and, after a day of marching and following the instructions received from the captives, reached the edge of the crater in which the stronghold and the makeshift lake were constructed. The lake glistened in the late afternoon sun and gently pressed against the dam built at its southern edge, preventing it from flowing freely down into the valley. Instead, the water slowly sifted down into a cave."

        [part]
            story= _ "Jacques knew that the first task would be to overcome the ogre outpost at the edge of the crater. Accordingly, he chose a small number of trusty warriors to come with him. Once this post was overcome, the others could come to join them - and Jacques would plan his next move..."
