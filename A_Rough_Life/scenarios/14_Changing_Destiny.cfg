            story= _ "Jacques and Kyoko, together with those of their faithful followers who, having gotten over the affliction inflicted on them by the old mage, shared their yearning for the sun, left the caves and set for the Shadowlands. "
        [/part]
        [part]
            story= _ "As they arrived to the desert valley, they saw that the dwarves, formerly enslaved by the Shadowhounds as their unwitting servants, spared little time in demolishing the remnants of this shadowy rule and repairing the fortress. It already looked almost suitable for living, thus assuaging at least some of Kyoko's secret worries."
        [/part]
        [part]
            story= _ "Only one problem remained - the valley was still a desert. How did this come about, Jacques wondered, if indeed it was once a fertile valley? Was it only the fall of the old fortress that caused this desolation, or was there more to it? Fortunately for him, the dwarves had some good news in this regard."
        [/part]
        [part]
            story= _ "As it happened, the valley was once blessed with a river, flowing from the mountains in the Northeast. Ruphulus, however, had other plans - he had the riverbed blocked high up in the mountains and the flow diverted underground, which enabled him both to have his ghastly shipments shipped to his netherworld by means of this river and to sap its life energy so as to create the impression of outer climate below ground."
        [/part]
        [part]
            story= _ "He did not do it himself, however, but hired a tribe of mountain brutes to do it for him. It was said that they built a big dam high up in the mountains and dug a cave to divert the water, albeit none of the dwarves has ever seen it. It was clear, however, that they maintained it for Ruphulus against payment in money and food, and regularly came down from the mountains for new shipments to be sent to him."
        [/part]
        [part]
            story= _ "As luck would have it, they were soon to come again. What Jacques didn't know was that they would be mad as the old mage had defaulted on his last payment. Not that he cared, however, as he had his own plans ready to be unleashed on them..."
