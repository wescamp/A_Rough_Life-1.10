            story= _ "That night, Jacques indeed had a dream, but it was a most peculiar one. He dreamt that he had returned to his home village of Mosh. But he was not the thief that had only recently left those shores, nor even a trapper. No, he was a king, and people cowered in fear at the mere sight of him. Was he a monster in their eyes? Was his face bursting with vengeance? And where was his family, where was his father?"

        [part]
            story= _ "Kyoko also had a dream. She dreamt she was a fly, buzzing around Ruphulus. He would try to swat her but she evaded him, blow after blow, and thus it went on for ages. Finally, she stopped and landed on the mage's knee, and Ruphulus broke a wide grin. His hand moved to deal the final blow, accompanied by his maniacal laughter. But then, laughter turned into a scream..."
        [/part]
        [part]
            story= _ "As Kyoko finally opened her eyes, she realized Jacques was shaking her awake. He wanted to know what had made her scream, but she couldn't tell him. After all, she didn't even know what it meant herself. So she brushed him aside and set about preparing for the long march. The sun was about to set and it would soon be time to get going."

        [part]
            story= _ "The little group bade farewell to Arbor and headed for the caves. Jacques was sad to part ways with such a formidable friend, but he was also determined to see this through. He led his people safely across the desert, encountering only one giant scorpion along the way."
        [/part]
        [part]
            story= _ "As they reached the entrance into the cave system, the guards cried out in bewilderment: the Princess was alive! The news spread quickly, and loud cheers were soon heard from various directions. As for Kyoko, she was home and her slightly improved complexion showed it. She ran for the grand chamber so fast that Jacques and his men could barely keep up..."

There are indeed Shadowhounds in the lands beyond, dangerous creatures that roam the dunes at night and eat whatever is in their way. They descend upon you like a swarm of locusts and start devouring your very life energy while you helplessly watch."
