(A medium-length campaign with 16 scenarios, some of them only conversation. Note: This is a story-driven campaign where both maps and battles may warrant further improvements - any advice welcome via the forum.)

(Version 1.1.3. Thanks to: Turuk, Orcish Shyde, melinath and xbriannova (coding and/or mapping help); bera, pixelmind, DUHH, Mefisto, and ink (portrait and/or sprite art); also featuring new mainline portraits by kitty, thespaceinvader and Valkier.
